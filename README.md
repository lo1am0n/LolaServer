## About
LolaSpigot is basically a modified vanilla Minecraft server similar to Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, and all of that other stuff. It is made to support plugins, generate the world with better performance, and a lot more! This is just a fun to do, educational project, so I don't expect many people to use this.
